Description of project:
I created a simple quiz application with four questions. The quiz is timed for 75 seconds and with every incorrect answer, the time remaining is reduced by 10 seconds. Upon clicking the submit button, the timer will start and the first question will appear. All the buttons are programmed to show whether the choice was correct or incorrect.

Challenges:

While struggling through this assignment, I feel that I have gotten a better grasp of JavaScript but I still feel quite far from feeling remotely comfortable with this language. Much of the code written for this project was based off of research, but I was able to write most of the planning and pseudocoding myself. This assignment is still incomplete, because I was unable to figure out how to get the scores recorded in my form. Please let me know if you have any tips to getting my code to run properly.
